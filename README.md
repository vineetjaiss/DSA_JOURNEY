# 🚀 My DSA Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository documenting my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)! This repo is my personal learning space where I solve problems, note key concepts, and track my growth as a programmer and problem solver.

## 📌 Why DSA?

Data Structures and Algorithms are the backbone of efficient programming. Mastering DSA improves:
- Problem-solving skills
- Coding interview preparation
- Understanding of time and space complexity
- Confidence in building optimized solutions
